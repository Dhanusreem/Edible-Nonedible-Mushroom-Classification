# Edible-Nonedible-Mushroom-Classification
The dataset is from kaggle (mushroom cleaned). It has [54035 rows x 2 columns].We are determining whether the mushroom is edible or not based on several factors such as cap-diameter, cap-shape, gill-attachment, gill-color, stem-height, stem-width,stem-color, season.In our implementation we have taken only the cap size as the independent variable and the class as the target variable. The class is Binary with 0 as Edible and 1 as Poisonous. We have performed Pre-processing i.e, deleted null and duplicated records, our data is cleaned with no null or duplicated values. We have done Hyper-parameter Tuning with 70 % testing and 30% training data. We have accurracy of 100% becase of overfitting(LIMITATION : since we are considering only 1 independent variable column, the accuracy is 100% i.e overfitting issue SOLUTION: We can consider 2 or more independent column for an acuurate accuracy.)IF we consider more parameters we can get rid of this issue of overfitting.We have implemented and plotted the correlation matrix that isused to identify and quantify the linear relationships between pairs of features.We have performed Scaling used to standardize the range of features. We then perform the Logistic regression for binary classification tasks because it models the probability of a binary outcome using a logistic function, providing a clear probabilistic interpretation and efficient training.
